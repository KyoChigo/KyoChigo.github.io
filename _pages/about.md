Hi, I am a first-year master's student from the Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University. My research interests focus on the integration of particle physics and geoscience, with a particular emphasis on neutrino science. I am a member of the KamLAND Collaboration, contributing to the KamLAND experiment and participating in the OBD (Ocean Bottom Detector) project.

Since my personal homepage has just been established, it still needs to be enriched with content :)

* I gave an oral presentation at the Physical Society of Japan 2025 Spring Meeting on March 21, 2025. The title of my presentation was "Development of Ocean Bottom Detector for Direct Measurement of Mantle Geoneutrinos 13: Assessment of Geoneutrino Flux Assuming Directional Sensitivity."
* I gave an poster presentation at the KamLAND Collaboration Meeting 2025 Spring on March 10-11, 2025. The title of my poster was "Geoneutrino Observations from the Ocean Floor: The Role of Directional Sensitivity."
